# Programs

Hello, my name is Mason Lipford and I am a soon to be graduate from Mount St. Mary's University with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Cyber Security. I have experience in Python, Java, C++, HTML, Javascript, Linux, Bash, AWS, and Azure but I feel most proficient with Python.

This Github is used for me to post and share the code I feel accomplished on. It will be a variety of self-created programs, senior project, and other class assigned work. 

Hope you enjoy!
Thanks, 
Mason Lipford
